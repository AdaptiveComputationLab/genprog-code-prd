This page lists GenProg-specific publications, focusing primarily on those whose
data and experiments were implemented on top of the GenProg codebase by researchers
related to the core GenProg team.  program-repair.org provides a much more
complete, community-supported list of papers related to program repair
generally, including papers that build upon or compare to GenProg.

This page is sorted topically:
