This page lists GenProg-specific publications, focusing primarily on those whose
data and experiments were implemented on top of the GenProg codebase by
researchers related to the core GenProg
team.  [program-repair.org](http://program-repair.org/) provides a much more
complete, community-supported list of papers related to program repair
generally, including papers that build upon or compare to GenProg.
